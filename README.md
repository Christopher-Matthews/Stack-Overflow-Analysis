# Stack-Overflow-Analysis
A brief look at stack overflow data to answer the question: Are remote workers more satisfied at their job?

### Installation
All files can be run with the standard Anaconda distribution and python 3. The JobSatisfactionML.ipynb requres importing the cleaning_function.py for preprocessing.

### Motivation
For this project I wanted to see what could be said for remote working and the effects it has on job satisfaction in the United States. To do this I used a publicly available datasource on kaggle: the 2017 StackOverflow Developers survey.

###### I wanted to know:

- How does remote working in the US differ from the rest of the world?
- Are remote workers happier at their jobs? And if so how much happier?
- What is the optimal amount of time to work out of the office (remote) to influence worker happiness?

### File Descriptions

There are 4 IPython notebooks. The JobSatisfactionML notebook takes the longest at run-time. It also requires importing the cleaning_function.py file for preprocessing. The Preprocessing notebook is just a step by step analysis of how I worked through creating the final cleaning_function.py file and won't provide any analysis of data. 

### Results

The high level results can be found in a blog post I wrote at (insert link when ready).

### Acknowledgments

Thank you to kaggle for hosting the StackOverflow data and stack overflow for providing incredible service. 
Data used in the project can be found at

The two files used are the public survey results and the schema which gives detail about the questions asked.
